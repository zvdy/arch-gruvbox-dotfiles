# Gruvbox Arch Linux Hyprland Dotfiles

This repository contains my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) Gruvbox-themed setup and the software I use daily. It aims to provide a simple, minimal, and visually appealing workflow and environment.

## Workflow

### Code Editor

For code editing, I use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). The configuration for LazyVim is located at [/config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua](/config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua) and utilizes the Gruvbox theme developed by [morhetz](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

### Term Manager

As a terminal manager and multiplexer, I use [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) with the [Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) to install add-ons, including the Gruvbox theme developed by [egel](https://github.com/egel/tmux-gruvbox). The configuration file for Tmux is located at [/config/.tmux.conf](/config/.tmux.conf) and for TPM at [/config/tmux/**](/config/tmux/).

### Browser

My primary browser is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), with the [Gruvbox by rgnx theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gruvboxtheme/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search). For the home page, I use the open-source [Night Tab extension](https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab).

### Music

I use Spotify for listening to music and podcasts, with the [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify) add-on to implement themes. I use the [Skaytacium/Gruvify](https://github.com/Skaytacium/Gruvify) theme.
